# Basic Inheritance:

# Task: Create a base class Animal with a method speak that prints "Animal speaks". 
# Then, create a derived class Dog that overrides the speak method to print" "Dog barks". 
# Demonstrate the usage of both classes.


class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")
class Dog(Animal):
     def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")  

d = Dog()
d.speak() 

# Multiple Inheritance:

# Task: Create two base classes, FlyingAnimal with a method fly that prints "Flying" 
# and SwimmingAnimal with a method swim that prints "Swimming". 
# Then, create a derived class Duck that inherits from both FlyingAnimal and SwimmingAnimal. 
# Demonstrate the usage of the Duck class.



# Super Keyword:

# Task: Create a base class Vehicle with an init method that initializes make and model. 
# Then, create a derived class Car that also initializes number_of_doors. 
# Use the super keyword to call the Vehicle's init method fromÂ theÂ CarÂ class.
